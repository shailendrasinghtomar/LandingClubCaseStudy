* Customers with salaries higher than 15000 are significantly better at repaying the principal amount then the rest.
* There is 20% chance of loan defaults in each ownership category but higher loan amounts in mortgage home ownership has high default rate than others.
* If installment is high in comparison to the total payment amount, then the customer has much higher chances to default .
